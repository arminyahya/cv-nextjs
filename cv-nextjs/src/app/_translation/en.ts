	chargoon_work_description: `A software company that produces web-based administrative software in four dimensions, whose special feature is to provide all its software together rather than separately. I started my activity in the infrastructure team of Chargoona, which is responsible for producing parts that are used in various software. Like the UI framework and projects that can develop without knowing the business of the user. We use Azure DevOps for task management. We have our own Docker server to test topic branches. Our front-end stack is React, Typescript. One of the interesting things I did was breaking down the UI framework into smaller packages, creating a diagrammatic environment inside the software with GoJS for database design, and an advanced form builder with many features, as well as migrating from old state management to Redux Toolkit because updating them wasnâ€™t cost-effective.`,

	yeganeh_soft_description: `Yeganeh Company was my first work experience where we developed web-based software for correspondence and document management. Our front-end stack was React and Typescript, and it was my first time getting familiar with Typescript there. We used Trello for task management. We developed our pages using the AntDesign framework. Some of our pages did not have ready-made components, so we developed them ourselves. It was my first time in the Yeganeh team getting acquainted with the concept of UX, and we interacted with the UX expert to ensure that the page implementation was in line with better user experience.`,
