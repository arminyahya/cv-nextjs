	chargoon_work_description: `Chagoon is a software company that specializes in developing enterprise software solutions for organizations. I began my career with the infrastructure team, where I was responsible for developing code that could be utilized across various software applications. This included creating UI frameworks and projects that could be developed without requiring a deep understanding of specific business operations. The frontend stack utilized at the company is ReactJS-Typescript. Some of my key projects included breaking down the UI framework codebase into smaller, more manageable packages, designing a diagram environment using the GoJS library to create database schemas, developing a feature-rich form builder, and migrating to Redux Toolkit from our old state management .`,

	yeganeh_soft_description: `Yeganeh Company was where I gained my initial work experience, focusing on the development of Electronic Document Management Systems (EDMS) and web-based document management solutions. The frontend technology stack utilized by the team was ReactJS-Typescript, which introduced me to TypeScript for the first time. Task management was handled through Trello, and we utilized the AntDesign framework for developing our web pages. In cases where ready-made components were not available, we developed custom components. My time at Yeganeh also marked my introduction to User Experience (UX) concepts, as we collaborated with a UX expert to ensure that our page designs prioritized user experience.`,
